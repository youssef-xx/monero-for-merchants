If you don't want to read everything, start here:

* [ ] Install a Monero wallet (Monerujo or Cake Wallet)
* [ ] Write down your 25‑word recovery phrase on paper
* [ ] Open **Receive** → show QR code to customers
* [ ] Optional: Create subaddresses to track payments
* [ ] Accept payment → wait for 1 confirmation (~20 sec)
* [ ] Move larger earnings to a cold wallet
* [ ] Save this guide for later (security tips & advanced tools)

This checklist will appear again at the end for quick reference.
Monero (XMR) is a digital cash system built for privacy, security, and true financial independence. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, Monero payments are private by default, extremely low-fee, and ideal for real-world commerce.

### **Why merchants use Monero:**

* **Privacy:** Transaction details are hidden from competitors, suppliers, and attackers.
* **No chargebacks:** Payments are final (similar to cash).
* **Global & borderless:** Customers from anywhere can pay instantly.
* **Low fees:** Typically fractions of a cent.
* **Simple UX:** Customers just scan a QR code.
* **Works even where traditional banking fails:** Ideal for regions with unstable financial infrastructure.

This guide is written **for non-technical merchants**, small businesses, and freelancers who want to accept Monero easily and safely.

## 2. What You Need (Minimal Setup)

Accepting Monero does *not* require running a node or understanding cryptography. You just need a wallet.

### **Option A — Mobile Wallet (Recommended for Small Shops)**

These wallets are easy, user‑friendly, and safe:

* **Monerujo (Android)**
* **Cake Wallet (iOS & Android)**

These options are best for:

* Cafés
* Small retail stores
* Barbers
* Freelancers
* Anyone wanting a simple POS setup

**Set up steps:**

1. Install a wallet from the official app store.
2. Create a new wallet.
3. Write down the 25‑word recovery phrase (on paper, not your phone).
4. Set a strong PIN.

### **Option B — Desktop Wallet (For Larger Businesses)**

If you need more control and bookkeeping:

* **Feather Wallet** (recommended)
* **Official Monero GUI Wallet**

These allow:

* View-only wallets for accountants
* Creating many subaddresses for tracking payments
* Easier cold storage management

## 3. Accepting Payments (The Simple Way)

This is the fastest and easiest method with no technical work.

### **Step 1: Display Your Monero Address (QR Code)**

Every wallet can show a QR code for receiving payments.

To accept payments:

1. Open your wallet.
2. Tap **Receive**.
3. Show or print the QR code.
4. Customer scans → pays → done.

### **Step 2: Confirm the Payment**

Monero wallets show incoming payments quickly.

* First confirmation arrives in ~20 seconds.
* Most merchants accept payment after 1 confirmation.
* High‑value orders can wait a bit longer.

### **Step 3: Track Sales (Subaddresses)**

You can generate a **new subaddress** for each:

* Order
* Day
* Customer
* Product

This makes it easy to track what was paid for.

### **Step 4: Move Earnings to Cold Storage**

For long‑term savings:

* Use Feather or the official GUI wallet.
* Keep large balances offline.
* Back up your recovery phrase safely.

## 4. Security Best Practices for Merchants

* **Use subaddresses** to track individual orders.
